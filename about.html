          <h4>Where I Come From</h4>
          <p>My name is Alice Loiton, and this is the story of my journey — a journey shaped by resilience, courage, and the belief that even the hardest beginnings can lead to beautiful destinations.</p>
          <p>I was born in Turkana, a place where life teaches you strength before you even understand its meaning. My story began with a separation — one I was too young to understand. At around 8 years old, I was separated from my parents. Since that day, I have never seen them again.</p>
          <p>I was raised by my grandmother, a strong woman who became my mentor, my comfort, and my role model. Growing up under her care in Turkana meant facing many hardships — hunger, insecurity, lack of resources, and a life where every day demanded resilience. But in those struggles, I learned something priceless: pain can shape purpose, and hardship can build heroes.</p>
          <p>My life changed when a well-wisher saw potential in me — potential I didn't even see in myself at that age. This well-wisher was Mekaela Academies. They believed I deserved a chance, a future, and an opportunity to become something great. They brought me to Mombasa, opening a door that transformed my entire life.</p>
          <p>How I came to Mombasa is a long, emotional story — one I hope to share one day in full. But this piece is enough to show the beginning of my journey: a journey from hardship to hope, from uncertainty to purpose.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
          <h4>Rising Through Challenges</h4>
          <p>Life was still not easy. I faced moments of doubt, pain, and loneliness. But every curve of my story strengthened me. I learned to rise. I learned to fight. I learned to believe in myself even when it felt impossible.</p>
          <p>Those experiences shaped the woman I became.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
          <h4>Becoming a Mentor</h4>
          <p>As I grew, I developed a passion for helping others find the strength that I once searched for. I trained in life skills, coaching, mental health support, communication, problem-solving, and youth mentorship. Empowering others helped me heal pieces of myself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
          <h4>Finding Purpose in Environmental Work</h4>
          <p>My calling for environmental protection grew as I watched how climate change and pollution affected people around me — especially communities like the one I grew up in. I knew I had to be part of the solution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section highlight-section">
          <h4>The Birth of Green Minds Youth Initiative</h4>
          <p>In 2023, my path shifted when I joined SambaSports Youth Trust as an attachee. Later, I became a volunteer — and it became the birthplace of the dream that would later become Green Minds.</p>
          <p>Through SambaSports, I gained mentorship, experience, and exposure. I attended environmental exhibitions, worked with communities, and discovered that my voice mattered. My leadership blossomed.</p>
          <p>Then an unbelievable moment came — I won a 3-year environmental grant. That grant became the wind that pushed my dream forward.</p>
          <p>In 2024, I officially registered Green Minds Youth Initiative as a Community-Based Organization (CBO). A dream that started from the dust of Turkana and the hands of my grandmother had finally found a home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
          <h4>Impact and Growth</h4>
          <p>Today, Green Minds Youth Initiative works with youth, schools, women groups, and community partners to:</p>

            <li>Advocate for environmental protection</li>

            <li>Provide drug and substance abuse mentorship</li>
            <li>Empower young leaders</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Watching young people grow and transform has become the purpose that drives me every day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
          <h4>Challenges Along the Way</h4>
          <p>The journey has never been perfect. There were moments of doubt. Moments of lacking resources. Moments of wondering if anyone saw what I was trying to build.</p>
          <p>But every challenge strengthened my purpose. Every obstacle became proof that I was meant to rise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section vision-section">
          <h4>My Vision</h4>
          <p>My dream is to see:</p>
          <ul class="vision-list">
            <li>Youth who believe in themselves</li>
            <li>A clean, green, empowered Kwale</li>
            <li>Communities working together for environmental justice</li>
            <li>A future where no child is limited by their background</li>

          <h4>A Message to Young People</h4>
          <p>Your beginning does not determine your ending.<br>
          Your past does not define your future.<br>
          Your story is powerful — even the painful parts.</p>
          <p>If you feel lost, remember:<br>
          You can rise. You can rebuild. You can become more than your struggles.</p>
          <p class="call-to-action">Start where you are. Keep moving.<br>
          Greatness often grows from the hardest places.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-closing">
          <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope it inspires someone out there to believe in their dreams, to rise above their challenges, and to work towards a brighter, greener future.</p>
          <p class="signature">This is my story — and I hope it lights a spark in yours.<br>
